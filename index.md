<br><br>
    <center><p>We should remember the people who served for our country because they threw away their life just so we can live in peace and happiness. They suffered
    so the future generations can be safe and could have an education. We take our lives for granted and we dont realize that
    we wouldn't have such and easy life if it wasn't for them. We don't have to worry about violence and wars today. We should be grateful and appreciate
    the gift they have given us.</p><center>
