<center><h1>How We Can Help</h1></center>
<br>
<center><p>There are many different ways we can help. One simple way is to just respect the people who have contributed to the war effort. Take one minute on November the 11th to be silence to respect everything they have gave us.</p></center>

<br>
<center><p>Another way we can help is to contribute to go fund me pages such as HeroFund.ca. These veterans suffered through a lot during the war and they still suffer after the war with depression, anxiety and PTSD. We should try to get involved with people who have gave us a gift of being in a country without war.</p></center>
