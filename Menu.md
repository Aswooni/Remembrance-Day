    <p>Did you know, more than 59,000 nurses (American) served in the army during World War II? As you an see, nurses served a big
       role during the war and we don't show enough respect for them. When we think of war and remembrance day, the first thing
       that comes to our mind are soldiers serving for our countries. We never think about the nurses who have gone through the
       same thing as soldiers. They deserve the same respect as anyone else during the war. They even served under fire, on trains,
       on ships and even as flights nurses. They are a big support to the army and should be recognized more.</p>
